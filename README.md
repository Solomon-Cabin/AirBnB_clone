		AirBnB Clone - The Console

This project is a collaborative effort between Itumeleng Malematja and Solomon Obinna.
aimed at creating a command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB objects.
The command interpreter serves as a text-based interface to interact with the AirBnB system by issuing command.

It allows users to create, retrieve, update,
and delete various objects within the AirBnB system, such as users, places, bookings.
This command interpreter serves as the backbone of the AirBnB application,
providing essential functionality for interacting with the system.

Once the command interpreter is running, users can interact with it by typing commands and pressing enter.

Here are some examples of commands that can be used with the AirBnB Command Interpreter:

1.Creating a New User:
	css:create user --name John --email john@example.com

2.Retrieving a Place:
	sql:get place --id 123456

3.Updating User Information:
	css:update user --id 987654 --email new_email@example.com

4.Deleting a Booking:
	sql:delete booking --id 789012

5.Listing Users:
	bash:list users
